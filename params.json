{"name":"Plain Text Life","tagline":"A template to organise life in plain text files","body":"# Hi!\r\n\r\nWelcome to the **Plain Text Life** project. This project consists of only\r\ntwo elements:\r\n\r\n1. The README you are reading right now,\r\n2. The `today.txt` template that assists you organising your everyday life\r\nin plain text files. Create one copy of `today.txt` for each day and use it\r\nas your journal/diary, to set your goal of today, to structure your morning,\r\nget done with your chores as quickly as possible, and to spend free time on\r\nthe things you love.\r\n\r\nThis template keeps your life structured in an easy to manage system and\r\nthereby frees up time and mental capacity for the things that really matter in\r\nlife such as relationships and personal growth. By using this template, you\r\ncan de-clutter your life from using countless apps, and systems. Instead you\r\ncan choose to use plain text files that will always work, will always remain\r\nreadable by any computer and thus never become inaccessible.\r\n\r\n# How to use it\r\n\r\n1. Create a folder `Life` somewhere on your computer (Tip: you can also\r\n  place this folder in a cloud folder, like Google Drive or Dropbox, to have\r\n  it synced across devices).\r\n2. Each day in the morning, after having set your coffee but before having\r\ndone any serious work, create a copy of `today.txt` and use today's date as\r\nthe filename like this: 2015-08-23.txt. This structure stands for YYYY-MM-DD.txt\r\nand follows the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard.\r\n3. Start writing by filling in blanks of the template.\r\n4. Whenever you feel like, add your thoughts to the file using the syntax\r\nbelow and hit save when you are done.\r\n\r\n# Syntax\r\n\r\nAlthough plain text files generally do not have a syntax, I recommend using\r\nthe default [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).\r\nMoreover, I advise you to separate elements with a blank line. Some examples:\r\n\r\n    # Heading\r\n\r\n    ## Sub-heading\r\n\r\n    - list item\r\n\r\n    todo: to mark a line as a todo for today\r\n\r\n    done: to mark a line as done for today\r\n\r\n    thought: to mark a line as a thought of today\r\n\r\n    experience: to mark a line as an experience of today\r\n\r\n    reflection: to mark a line as a reflection of today\r\n\r\n    idea: to mark a line as an idea of today\r\n\r\n    feeling: to mark a line as a feeling of today\r\n\r\n    @context to indicate the context of a line\r\n\r\n    +project to indicate the project to which a line belongs to\r\n\r\n    (A) (B) (C) to indicate the priority of a line\r\n\r\n\r\n# Recommended software\r\n\r\nIf you are still looking for a software recommendation, then try one of the\r\nbelows:\r\n\r\n* Linux: [Calmy Writer](http://calmlywriter.com/), [Focuswriter](http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/)\r\n* Android: [JotterPad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jotterpad.x)\r\n* iPhone:\r\n* iPad:\r\n* Mac: [Calmy Writer](http://calmlywriter.com/), [Focuswriter](http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/)\r\n* Windows: [Calmy Writer](http://calmlywriter.com/), [Focuswriter](http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/)\r\n* ChromeOS: [Calmy Writer](http://calmlywriter.com/)\r\n\r\n# Working with your plain text files\r\n\r\nStart a software that indexes all your plain text files. On Linux I recommend\r\n[Recoll](http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/download.html#general). Search for\r\nkeywords or tags that you remember and quickly find the right file you were\r\nlooking for.\r\n\r\n# Attribution\r\n\r\nThanks to [John Henry MÃ¼ller](http://johnhenrymuller.com/today) from whom\r\nI took the inspiration to extend his initial template.\r\n\r\n# Contribute\r\n\r\nI am very happy for all kind of feedback that make this template more useful\r\nto other people.
